# Xdle
Like Contexto and Wordle but you find a number instead of a word!

# Installation and setting up
1. Clone the repository into your device:
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:Dapples0/Xdle.git
    ```
2. Move to root directory and install the required packages
    ```sh
    cd Xdle
    ```

    ```sh
    npm i
    ```

# Running the frontend
To run the frontend, run the following line
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

  Afterwards, open the local host site link that will appear in the terminal.


# (Self-Reflection) Future additions and improvements
1. Backend to store daily number.
2. Improved frontend design for better responsiveness.
3. Have hints section be more clearer.
4. Add victory screen instead of appearing on top of page.
